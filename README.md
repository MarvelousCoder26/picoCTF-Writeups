# picoCTF-Writeups
This year, I participated in picoCTF, and scored 5000 points. Here are the unofficial writeups to the challenges I completed. Every challenge I completed will have a directory associated with it, which includes the target files, a writeup of my solution, and any scripts I wrote to aid me. Most of these scripts will be in python.
