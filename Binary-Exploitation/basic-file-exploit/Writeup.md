**Description:**
The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!
Connect to the program with netcat:
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/541/program-redacted.c).

**Explaination:**
If you download the c file associated with this challenge, it seems pretty complicated, but if you scan it for clues, you'll find the following if statement in the data_read function:

if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
}

You'll notice that the flag is printed is the function strtol returns zero, and if you look at the [c documentation for strtol](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strtol.htm) you'll see that it returns zero when an string is illegally converted into an integer. More code tracting will reveal that strtol is called when trying to read an input from the database.

**Solution:**
1) Connect to the server by typing nc saturn.picoctf.net 49698 into your preferred command line
2) Follow the instructions to enter a phrase into the database.
3) Follow the instructions to echo a phrase from the database, but type in any word instead of a number. This will print out the flag.
